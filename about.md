## About Ben

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Headshot.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I am a seasoned polyglot developer and development team lead with more than a decade of experience under his belt.
I have worked across the board from small startups to multiple Fortune 100 companies. I specialize in Java, Groovy
on Grails and Kotlin development with excellent Javascript skills across several major frameworks. As of March 2023 I am
entertaining new roles from IC to Director. In addition, I am currently offering training to companies on how to build
exceptionally high performing teams through standardized processes and templatize current and future development efforts.
Contact me for details today!!!

In my free time I am an avid media consumer and technology tinkerer. I enjoy working on home automation projects and
figuring out how to do more with less with my technology. When I'm not watching a good movie or working on some personal
project I like to Dj in my spare time and enjoy the company of friends.
